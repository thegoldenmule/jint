#### Jint-Unity

`Jint-Unity` is a fork of **[Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint)**: a Javscript interpreter for .NET. This fork provides a few things that Jint proper does not:

* Compliant with the **.NET 3.5 Subset** that Unity uses.
* Fixes for **iOS compatibility**: yes, this runs on iOS!
* **Deep integration** with Unity: APIs for days!
* An awesome **Unity scene query language** aptly named UQL.
* Lots of Unity examples-- including a **full REPL**.
